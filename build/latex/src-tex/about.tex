The material in this book has been edited from talks given at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in January 1984, with the exception of three sections: `\textit{Effort and Relaxation},' `\textit{Kindness},' `\textit{The Hindrances and Their Cessation},' which were taken from talks given at Wat Pah Nanachat International Forest Monastery, Ubon, N.E. Thailand in December 1982.

{\scshape \theauthor} was born in the USA, became a bhikkhu in 1967 and trained 9 years under Ajahn Chah at Wat Pah Pong, a forest monastery in Ubon province, Thailand.  In 1976 he was invited to Britain; he established Cittaviveka (Chithurst Buddhist Monastery) in West Sussex in 1979, and Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire in 1984. During his 34 years of being based in Britain, he taught extensively throughout the world, ordained many monks and nuns, and also authorised the establishment of six other monasteries.  Many of his talks are available in audio versions, and some have been transcribed and edited into a collection of books.

In November 2010, Ajahn Sumedho put aside his duties as abbot and teacher and is practising in more secluded environments.
