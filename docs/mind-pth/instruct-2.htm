          of the Ordinary</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now for the next hour we'll do the walking practice, 
          using the motion of walking as the object of concentration, bringing 
          your attention to the movement of your feet, and the pressure of the 
          feet touching the ground. You can use the <em>mantra</em> 'Buddho' for 
          that also -- 'Bud' for the right, '-dho' for the left, using the span 
          of the <em>jongrom</em> path. See if you can be fully with, fully alert 
          to the sensation of walking from the beginning of the <em>jongrom</em> 
          path to the end. Use an ordinary pace, then you can slow it down or 
          speed it up accordingly. Develop a normal pace, because our meditation 
          moves around the ordinary things rather than the special. We use the 
          ordinary breath, not a special 'breathing practice'; the sitting posture 
          rather than standing on our heads; normal walking rather than running, 
          jogging or walking methodically slowly -- just a relaxed pace. We're 
          practising around what's most ordinary, because we take it for granted. 
          But now we're bringing our attention to all the things we've taken for 
          granted and never noticed, such as our own minds and bodies. Even doctors 
          trained in physiology and anatomy are not really <em>with</em> their 
          bodies. They sleep with their bodies, they're born with their bodies, 
          they grow old, have to live with them, feed them, exercise them and 
          yet they'll tell you about a liver as if it was on a chart. It's easier 
          to look at a liver on a chart than to be aware of your own liver, isn't 
          it? So we look at the world as if somehow we aren't a part of it and 
          what's most ordinary, what's most common we miss, because we're looking 
          at what's extraordinary. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> Television is extraordinary. They can put all kinds 
          of fantastic adventurous romantic things on the television. It's a miraculous 
          thing, so it's easy to concentrate on. You can get mesmerised by the 
          'telly'. Also, when the body becomes extraordinary, say it becomes very 
          ill, or very painful, or it feels ecstatic or wonderful feelings go 
          through it, we notice that! But just the pressure of the right foot 
          on the ground, just the movement of the breath, just the feeling of 
          your body sitting on the seat when there's not any kind of extreme sensation 
          -- those are the things we're awakened to now. We're bringing our attention 
          to the way things are for an ordinary life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> <a name="When">When</a> life becomes extreme, or extraordinary, 
          then we find we can cope with it quite well. Pacifists and conscientious 
          objectors are often asked this famous question, 'You don't believe in 
          violence, so what would you do if a maniac was attacking your mother?' 
          That's something that I think most of us have never had to worry about 
          very much! It's not the kind of ordinary daily occurrence in one's life. 
          But if such an extreme situation did arise, I'm sure we would do something 
          that would be appropriate. Even the nuttiest person can be mindful in 
          extreme situations. But in ordinary life when there isn't anything extreme 
          going on, when we're just sitting here, we can be completely nutty, 
          can't we? It says in the <em>Patimokkha</em>[<a href="#5">5</a>] discipline 
          that we monks shouldn't hit anyone. So then I sit here worrying about 
          what I would do if a maniac attacks my mother. I've created a great 
          moral problem in an ordinary situation, when I'm sitting here and my 
          mother isn't even here. In all these years there hasn't been the slightest 
          threat to my mother's life from maniacs (from California drivers, yes!). 
          Great moral questions we can answer easily in accordance with time and 
          place if, now, we're mindful of <em>this</em> time and <em>this</em> 
          place. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> So we're bringing attention to the ordinariness of 
          our human condition; the breathing of the body; the walking from one 
          end of the <em>jongrom</em> path to the other; and to the feelings of 
          pleasure and pain. As we go on in the retreat, we examine absolutely 
          everything, watch and know everything as it is. This is our practice 
          of <em>vipassana</em> -- to know things as they are, not according to 
          some theory or some assumption we make about them.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#9999CC"><a name="listen"></a>Listening 
          to Thought</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In opening the mind, or 'letting go', we bring attention 
          to one point on just watching, or being the silent witness who is aware 
          of what comes and goes. With this <em>vipassana</em> (insight) meditation, 
          we're using the three characteristics of <em>anicca</em> (change), <em>dukkha</em> 
          (unsatisfactoriness), <em>anatta</em> (not-self) to observe mental and 
          physical phenomena. We're freeing the mind from blindly repressing, 
          so if we become obsessed with any trivial thoughts or fears, or doubts, 
          worries or anger, we don't need to analyse it. We don't have to figure 
          out why we have it, but just make it fully conscious. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If you're really frightened of something, consciously 
          be frightened. Don't just back away from it, but notice that tendency 
          to try to get rid of it. Bring up fully what you're frightened of, think 
          it out quite deliberately, and listen to your thinking. This is not 
          to analyse, but just to take fear to its absurd end, where it becomes 
          so ridiculous you can start laughing at it. Listen to desire, the mad 
          'I want this, I want that, I've got to have, I don't know what I'll 
          do if I don't have this, and I want that ...' Sometimes the mind can 
          just scream away, 'I <em>want</em> this!' -- and you can listen to that. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> I was reading about confrontations, where you scream 
          at each other and that kind of thing, say all the repressed things in 
          your mind; this is a kind of catharsis, but it lacks wise reflection. 
          It lacks the skill of listening to that screaming as a condition, rather 
          than just as a kind of 'letting oneself go', and saying what one really 
          thinks. It lacks that steadiness of mind, which is willing to endure 
          the most horrible thoughts. In this way, we're not believing that those 
          are personal problems, but instead taking fear and anger, mentally, 
          to an absurd position, to where they're just seen as a natural progression 
          of thoughts. We're deliberately thinking all the things we're afraid 
          of thinking, not just out of blindness, but actually watching and listening 
          to them as conditions of the mind, rather than personal failures or 
          problems. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So, in this practice now, we begin to let things go. 
          You don't have to go round looking for particular things, but when things 
          which you feel obsessed with keep arising, bothering you, and you're 
          trying to get rid of them, then bring them up even more. Deliberately 
          think them out and listen, like you're listening to someone talking 
          on the other side of the fence, some gossipy old fish-wife: 'We did 
          this, and we did that, and then we did this and then we did that ...' 
          and this old lady just goes rambling on! Now, practise just listening 
          to it here as a voice, rather than judging it, saying, 'No, no, I hope 
          that's not me, that's not my true nature', or trying to shut her up 
          and saying, 'Oh, you old bag, I wish you'd go away!' We all have that, 
          even I have that tendency. It's just a condition of nature, isn't it? 
          It's not a person. So, this nagging tendency in us -- 'I work so hard, 
          nobody is ever grateful' -- is a condition, not a person. Sometimes 
          when you're grumpy, nobody can do anything right -- even when they're 
          doing it right, they're doing it wrong. That's another condition of 
          the mind, it's not a person. The grumpiness, the grumpy state of mind 
          is known as a condition: <em>anicca</em> -- it changes; <em>dukkha</em> 
          -- it is not satisfactory; <em>anatta</em> -- it is not a person. There's 
          the fear of what others will think of you if you come in late: you've 
          overslept, you come in, and then you start worrying about what everyone's 
          thinking of you for coming in late -- 'They think I'm lazy.' Worrying 
          about what others think is a condition of the mind. Or we're always 
          here on time, and somebody else comes in late, and we think, 'They always 
          come in late, can't they ever be on time!' That also is another condition 
          of the mind. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I'm bringing this up into full consciousness, these 
          trivial things, which you can just push aside because they are trivial, 
          and one doesn't want to be bothered with the trivialities of life; but 
          when we don't bother, then all that gets repressed, so it becomes a 
          problem. We start feeling anxiety, feeling aversion to ourselves or 
          to other people, or depressed; all this comes from refusing to allow 
          conditions, trivialities, or horrible things to become conscious. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Then there is the doubting state of mind, never quite 
          sure what to do: there's fear and doubt, uncertainty and hesitation. 
          Deliberately bring up that state of never being sure, just to be relaxed 
          with that state of where the mind is when you're not grasping hold of 
          any particular thing. 'What should I do, should I stay or should I go, 
          should I do this or should I do that, should I do <em>anapanasati</em> 
          or should I do <em>vipassana</em>?' Look at that. Ask yourself questions 
          that can't be answered, like 'Who am l?' Notice that empty space before 
          you start thinking it -- 'who?' -- just be alert, just close your eyes, 
          and just before you think 'who', just look, the mind's quite empty, 
          isn't it? Then, 'Who-am-l?', and then the space after the question mark. 
          That thought comes and goes out of emptiness, doesn't it? When you're 
          just caught in habitual thinking, you can't see the arising of thought, 
          can you? You can't see, you can only catch thought after you realise 
          you've been thinking; so start deliberately thinking, and catch the 
          beginning of a thought, before you actually think it. You take deliberate 
          thoughts like, 'Who is the Buddha?' Deliberately think that, so that 
          you see the beginning, the forming of a thought, and the end of it, 
          and the space around it. You're looking at thought and concept in a 
          perspective, rather than just reacting to them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Say you're angry with somebody. You think, 'That's what 
          he said, he said that and he said this and then he did this and he didn't 
          do that right, and he did that all wrong, he's so selfish ... and then 
          I remember what he did to so-and-so, and then ...' One thing goes on 
          to the next, doesn't it? You're just caught in this one thing going 
          on to the next, motivated by aversion. So rather than just being caught 
          in that whole stream of associated thoughts, concepts, deliberately 
          think: 'He is the most selfish person I have ever met.' And then the 
          ending, emptiness. 'He is a rotten egg, a dirty rat, he did this and 
          then he did that', and you can see, it's really funny, isn't it? When 
          I first went to Wat Pah Pong, I used to have tremendous anger and aversion 
          arise. I'd just feel so frustrated, sometimes because I never knew what 
          was really happening, and I didn 't want to have to conform so much 
          as I had to there. I was just fuming. Ajahn Chah would be going on -- 
          he could give two hour talks in Lao -- and I'd have a terrible pain 
          in the knees. So I'd have those thoughts: 'Why don't you ever stop talking? 
          I thought Dhamma was simple, why does he have to take two hours to say 
          something?' I'd become very critical of everybody, and then I started 
          reflecting on this and listening to myself, getting angry, being critical, 
          being nasty, resenting, 'I don't want this I don't want that, I don't 
          like this, I don't see why I have to sit here, I don't want to be bothered 
          with this silly thing, I don't know ...', on and on. And I kept thinking, 
          'Is that a very nice person that's saying that? Is that what you want 
          to be like, that thing that's always complaining and criticising, finding 
          fault, is that the kind of person you want to be?' 'No! I don't want 
          to be like that.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">But I had to make it fully conscious to really see it, 
          rather than believe in it. I felt very righteous within myself, and 
          when you feel righteous, and indignant, and you're feeling that they're 
          wrong, then you can easily believe those kinds of thoughts: 'I see no 
          need for this kind of thing, after all, the Buddha said ... the Buddha 
          would never have allowed this, the Buddha; I know Buddhism!' Bring it 
          up into conscious form, where you can see it, make it absurd, and then 
          you have a perspective on it and it gets quite amusing. You can see 
          what comedy is about! We take ourselves so seriously, 'I'm such an important 
          person, my life is so terribly important, that I must be extremely serious 
          about it at all moments. My problems are so important, so terribly important; 
          I have to spend a lot of time with my problems because they're so important.' 
          One thinks of oneself somehow as very important, so then think it, deliberately 
          think, 'I'm a Very Important Person, my problems are very important 
          and serious.' When you're thinking that, it sounds funny, it sounds 
          silly, because really, you realise you're not terribly important -- 
          none of us are. And the problems we make out of life are trivial things. 
          Some people can ruin their whole lives by creating endless problems, 
          and taking it all so seriously. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If you think of yourself as an important and serious 
          person, then trivial things or foolish things are things that you don't 
          want. If you want to be a good person, and a saintly one, then evil 
          conditions are things that you have to repress out of consciousness. 
          If you want to be a loving and generous type of being, then any type 
          of meanness or jealousy or stinginess is something that you have to 
          repress or annihilate in your mind. So whatever you are most afraid 
          of in your life that you might really be, think it out, watch it. Make 
          confessions: 'I want to be a tyrant!'; 'I want to be a heroin smuggler!'; 
          'I want to be a member of the Mafia!'; 'I want to ...' Whatever it is. 
          We're not concerned with the quality of it any more, but the mere characteristic 
          that it's an impermanent condition; it's unsatisfactory, because there's 
          no point in it that can ever really satisfy you. It comes and it goes, 
          and it's not-self.</font></p>

          Hindrances &amp; their Cessation</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">As we listen inwardly, we begin to recognise the whispering 
          voices of guilt, remorse and desire, jealousy and fear, lust and greed. 
          Sometimes you can listen to what lust says: 'I want, I've got to have, 
          I've got to have, I want, I want!' Sometimes it doesn't even have any 
          object. You can just feel lust with no object, so you find an object. 
          The desire to get something, 'I want something, I want something! I've 
          got to have something, I want ...' You can hear that if you listen to 
          your mind. Usually we find an object for lust, such as sex; or we can 
          spend our time fantasising. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Lust may take the form of looking for something to eat, 
          or anything to absorb into, become something, unite with something. 
          Lust is always on the look-out, always seeking for something. It can 
          be an attractive object which is allowable for monks, like a nice robe 
          or an alms bowl or some delicious food. You can see the inclination 
          to want it, to touch it, to try and somehow get it, own it, possess 
          it, make it mine, consume. And that's lust, that's a force in nature 
          which we must recognise; not to condemn it and say, 'I'm a terrible 
          person because I have lust!' -- because that's another ego reinforcement, 
          isn't it? As if we are not supposed to have any lust, as if there were 
          any human being who didn't experience desire for something! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">These are conditions in nature which we must recognise 
          and see; not through condemnation, but through understanding them. So 
          we get to really know the movement in our mind of lust, greed, seeking 
          something -- and the desire-to-get-rid-of. You can witness that also 
          -- wanting to get rid of something you have, or some situation, or pain 
          itself. 'I want to get rid of the pain I have, I want to get rid of 
          my weakness, I want to get rid of dullness, I want to get rid of my 
          restlessness, my lust. I want to get rid of everything that annoys me. 
          Why did God create mosquitoes? I want to get rid of the pests.' </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Sensual desire is the first of the hindrances (<em>nivarana</em>). 
          Aversion is the second one; your mind is haunted with not wanting, with 
          petty irritations and resentments, and then you try and annihilate them. 
          So that's an obstacle to your mental vision, that's a hindrance. I'm 
          not saying we should try to get rid of that hindrance -- that's aversion 
          -- but to know it, to know its force, to understand it as you experience 
          it. Then you recognise the desire to get rid of things in yourself, 
          the desire to get rid of things around you, desire not to be here, desire 
          not to be alive, desire to no longer exist. That's why we like to sleep, 
          isn't it? Then we can not exist for a while. In sleep consciousness 
          we don't exist because there isn't that same feeling of being alive 
          anymore. That's annihilation. So some people like to sleep a lot because 
          living is too painful for them, too boring, too unpleasant. We get depressed, 
          full of doubt and despair, and we tend to seek an escape through sleep; 
          trying to annihilate our problems, force them out of consciousness. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The third hindrance is sleepiness, lethargy, dullness, 
          sloth, drowsiness, torpor; we tend to react to this with aversion. But 
          this also can be understood. Dullness can be known -- the heaviness 
          of body and mind, slow, dull movement. Witness the aversion to it, the 
          wanting to get rid of it. You observe the feeling of dullness in the 
          body and mind. Even the knowledge of dullness is changing, unsatisfactory, 
          not-self (<em>anicca</em>, <em>dukkha</em>, <em>anatta</em>). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Restlessness is the opposite of dullness; this is the 
          fourth hindrance. You're not dull at all, you're not sleepy, but restless, 
          nervous, anxious, tense. Again, it may have no specific object. Rather 
          than the feeling of wanting to sleep, restlessness is a more obsessive 
          state. You want to do something, run here ... do this ... do that ... 
          talk, go round, run around. And if you have to sit still for a little 
          while when you're feeling restless, you feel penned in, caged; all you 
          can think of is jumping, running about, doing something. So you can 
          witness that also, especially when you're contained within a form where 
          you can't just follow restlessness. The robes that bhikkhus wear are 
          not conducive to jumping up into trees and swinging from the branches. 
          We can't act out this leaping tendency of the mind, so we have to watch 
          it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Doubt is the fifth hindrance. Sometimes our doubts may 
          seem very important, and we like to give them a lot of attention. We 
          are very deluded by the quality of it, because it appears to be so substantial: 
          'Some doubts are trivial, yes, but this is an Important Doubt. I've 
          got to know the answer. I've got to be sure. I've got to know definitely, 
          should I do this or should I do that! Am I doing this right? Should 
          I go there, or should I stay here a bit longer? Am I wasting my time? 
          Have I been wasting my life? Is Buddhism the right way or isn't it? 
          Maybe it's not the right religion!' This is doubt. You can spend the 
          rest of your life worrying about whether you should do this or that, 
          but one thing you can know is that doubt is a condition of the mind. 
          Sometimes that tends to be very subtle and deluding. In our position 
          as 'the one who knows', we know doubt is doubt. Whether it's an important 
          or trivial one, it's just doubt, that's all. 'Should I stay here,or 
          should I go somewhere else?' It's doubt. 'Should I wash my clothes today 
          or tomorrow?' That's doubt. Not very important, but then there are the 
          important ones. 'Have I attained Stream Entry yet? What is a Stream 
          Enterer, anyway? Is Ajahn Sumedho an <em>Arahant</em> (enlightened one)? 
          Are there any <em>Arahants</em> at the present time?' Then people from 
          other religions come and say, 'Yours is wrong, ours is right!' Then 
          you think, 'Maybe they're right! Maybe ours is wrong.' What we <em>can</em> 
          know is that there is doubt. This is being the knowing, knowing what 
          we can know, knowing that we don't know. Even when you're ignorant of 
          something, if you're aware of the fact that you don't know, then that 
          awareness is knowledge. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So this is being the knowing, knowing what we can know. 
          The Five Hindrances are your teachers, because they're not the inspiring, 
          radiant gurus from the picture books. They can be pretty trivial, petty, 
          foolish, annoying and obsessive. They keep pushing, jabbing, knocking 
          us down all the time until we give them proper attention and understanding, 
          until they are no longer problems. That's why one has to be very patient; 
          we have to have all the patience in the world, and the humility to learn 
          from these five teachers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">And what do we learn? That these are just conditions 
          in the mind; they arise and pass away; they're unsatisfactory, not-self. 
          Sometimes one has very important messages in one's life. We tend to 
          believe those messages, but what we <em>can</em> know is that those 
          are changing conditions: and if we patiently endure through that, then 
          things change automatically, on their own, and we have the openness 
          and clarity of mind to act spontaneously, rather than react to conditions. 
          With bare attention, with mindfulness, things go on their own, you don't 
          have to get rid of them because everything that begins, ends. There 
          is nothing to get rid of, you just have to be patient with them and 
          allow things to take their natural course into cessation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When you are patient, allowing things to cease, then 
          you begin to know cessation -- silence, emptiness, clarity -- the mind 
          clears, stillness. The mind is still vibrant, it's not oblivious, repressed 
          or asleep, and you can hear the silence of the mind. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To allow cessation means that we have to be very kind, 
          very gentle and patient, humble, not taking sides with anything, the 
          good, the bad, the pleasure, or the pain. Gentle recognition allows 
          things to change according to their nature, without interfering. So 
          then we learn to turn away from seeking absorption into the objects 
          of the senses. We find our peace in the emptiness of the mind, in its 
          clarity, in its silence.</font></p>

          and Form</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When your mind is quiet, listen, and you can hear that 
          vibrational sound in the mind -- 'the sound of silence'. What is it? 
          Is it an ear sound, or is it an outward sound? Is it the sound of the 
          mind or the sound of the nervous system, or what? Whatever it is, it's 
          always there, and it can be used in meditation as something to turn 
          toward. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Recognising that all that arises passes away, we begin 
          to look at that which doesn't arise or pass, and is always there. If 
          you start trying to think about that sound, have a name for it, or claim 
          any kind of attainments from it, then of course you are using it in 
          the wrong way. It's merely a standard to refer to when you've reached 
          the limit of the mind, and the end of the mind as far as we can observe 
          it. So from that position you can begin to watch. You can think and 
          still hear that sound (if you're thinking deliberately, that is), but 
          once you're lost in thought, then you forget it and you don't hear it 
          anymore. So if you get lost in thought, then once you're aware that 
          you're thinking again, turn to that sound, and listen to it for a long 
          time. Where before you'd get carried away by emotions or obsessions 
          or the hindrances that arise, now you can practise by gently, very patiently 
          reflecting on the particular condition of the mind as <em>anicca</em>, 
          <em>dukkha</em>, <em>anatta</em>, and then letting go of it. It's a 
          gentle, subtle letting go, not a slam-bang rejection of any condition. 
          So the attitude, the right understanding is more important than anything 
          else. Don't make anything out of that sound of silence. People get excited, 
          thinking they've attained something, or discovered something, but that 
          in itself is another condition you create around the silence. This is 
          a very cool practice, not an exciting one; use it skilfully and gently 
          for letting go, rather than for holding onto a view that you've attained 
          something! If there's anything that blocks anyone in their meditation, 
          it's the view that they've attained something from it! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now, you can reflect on the conditions of the body and 
          mind and concentrate on them. You can sweep through the body and recognise 
          sensations, such as the vibrations in the hands or feet, or you can 
          concentrate on any point in your body. Feel the sensation of the tongue 
          in the mouth, touching the palate, or the upper lip on top of the lower, 
          or just bring into the consciousness the sensation of wetness of the 
          mouth, or the pressure of the clothes on your body -- just those subtle 
          sensations that we don't bother to notice. Reflecting on these subtle 
          physical sensations, concentrate on them and your body will relax. The 
          human body likes to be noticed. It appreciates being concentrated on 
          in a gentle and peaceful way, but if you're inconsiderate and hate the 
          body, it really starts becoming quite unbearable. Remember we have to 
          live within this structure for the rest of our lives. So you'd better 
          learn how to live in it with a good attitude. You say, 'Oh, the body 
          doesn't matter, it's just a disgusting thing, gets old, gets sick and 
          dies. The body doesn't matter, it's the mind that counts.' That attitude 
          is quite common amongst Buddhists! But it actually takes patience to 
          concentrate on your body, other than out of vanity. Vanity is a misuse 
          of the human body, but this sweeping awareness is skilful. It's not 
          to enforce a sense of ego, but simply an act of goodwill and consideration 
          for a living body -- which is not you anyway </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><a name="So">So</a> your meditation now is on the five 
          <em>khandhas</em>[<a
href="#6">6</a>] and the emptiness of the mind. Investigate these until you fully 
          understand that all that arises passes away and is not-self. Then there's 
          no grasping of anything as being oneself, and you are free from that 
          desire to know yourself as a quality or a substance. This is liberation 
          from birth and death. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This path of wisdom is not one of developing concentration 
          to get into a trance state, get high and get away from things. You have 
          to be very honest about intention. Are we meditating to run away from 
          things? Are we trying to get into a state where we can suppress all 
          thoughts? This wisdom practice is a very gentle one of even allowing 
          the most horrible thoughts to appear, and let them go. You have an escape 
          hatch, it's like a safety valve where you can let off the steam when 
          there's too much pressure. Normally, if you dream a lot, then you can 
          let off steam in sleep. But no wisdom comes from that, does it? That 
          is just like being a dumb animal; you develop a habit of doing something 
          and then getting exhausted, then crashing out, then getting up, doing 
          something and crashing out again. But this path is a thorough investigation 
          and an understanding of the limitations of the mortal condition of the 
          body and mind. Now you're developing the ability to turn away from the 
          conditioned and to release your identity from mortality. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You're breaking through that illusion that you're a 
          mortal thing -- but I'm not telling you that you're an immortal creature 
          either, because you'll start grasping at <em>that</em>! 'My true nature 
          is one with the ultimate, absolute Truth. I am one with the Lord. My 
          real nature is the Deathless, timeless eternity of bliss.' But you notice 
          that the Buddha refrained from using poetic inspiring phrases; not that 
          they're wrong, but because we attach to them. We would settle for that 
          identity with the ultimate, or one with God, or the eternal bliss of 
          the Deathless Realm, and so forth. You get very starry-eyed saying things 
          like that. But it's much more skilful to watch that tendency to want 
          to name or conceive what is inconceivable, to be able to tell somebody 
          else, or describe it just to feel that you have attained something. 
          It is more important to watch that than to follow it. Not that you haven't 
          realised anything, either, but be that careful and that vigilant not 
          to attach to that realisation, because if you do, of course this will 
          just take you to despair again. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If you do get carried away, as soon as you realise you 
          got carried away, then stop. Certainly don't go round feeling guilty 
          about it or being discouraged, but just stop that. Calm down, let go, 
          let go of it. You notice that religious people have insights, and they 
          get very glassy-eyed. Born-again Christians are just aglow with this 
          fervour. Very impressive, too! I must admit, it's very impressive to 
          see people so radiant. But in Buddhism, that state is called '<em>sañña-vipallasa</em>' 
          -- 'meditation madness'. When a good teacher sees you're in that state, 
          he puts you in a hut out in the woods and tells you not to go near anyone! 
          I remember I went like that in Nong Khai the first year before I went 
          to Ajahn Chah, I thought I was fully enlightened, just sitting there 
          in my hut. I knew everything in the world, understood everything. I 
          was just so radiant, and ... but I didn't have anyone to talk to. I 
          couldn't speak Thai, so I couldn't go and hassle the Thai monks. But 
          the British Consul from Vientiane happened to come over one day, and 
          somebody brought him to my hut ... and I really let him have it, double 
          barrelled! He sat there in a stunned state, and, being English, he was 
          very, very, very polite, and every time he got up to go I wouldn't let 
          him. I couldn't stop, it was like Niagara Falls, this enormous power 
          coming out, and there was no way I could stop it myself. Finally he 
          left, made an escape somehow: I never saw him again, I wonder why?! 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So when we go through that kind of experience, it's 
          important to recognise it. It's nothing dangerous if you know what it 
          is. Be patient with it, don't believe it or indulge in it. You notice 
          Buddhist monks never go around saying much about what 'level of enlightenment' 
          they have -- it's just not to be related. When people ask us to teach, 
          we don't teach about our enlightenment, but about the Four Noble Truths 
          as the way for <em>them</em> to be enlightened. Nowadays there are all 
          kinds of people claiming to be enlightened or Maitreya Buddhas, avatars, 
          and all have large followings; people are willing to believe that quite 
          easily! But this particular emphasis of the Buddha is on recognising 
          the way things <em>are</em> rather than <em>believing</em> in what other 
          people tell us, or say. This is a path of wisdom, in which we're exploring 
          or investigating the limits of the mind. Witness and see: '<em>sabbe 
          sankhara anicca</em>', 'all conditioned phenomena are impermanent'; 
          '<em>sabbe dhamma anatta</em>', 'all things are not-self.' </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Now, as to the practice of mindfulness. Concentration 
          is where you put your attention on an object, sustain your attention 
          on that one point (such as the tranquillising rhythm of normal breathing), 
          until you become that sign itself, and the sense of subject and object 
          diminishes. Mindfulness, with <em>vipassana</em> meditation, is the 
          opening of the mind. You no longer concentrate on just one point, but 
          you observe insightfully and reflect on the conditions that come and 
          go, and on the silence of the empty mind. To do this involves letting 
          go of an object; you're not holding on to any particular object, but 
          observing that whatever arises passes away. This is insight meditation, 
          or '<em>vipassana</em>'. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">With what I call 'inner listening', you can hear the 
          noises that go on in the mind, the desire, the fears, things that you've 
          repressed and have never allowed to be fully conscious. But now, even 
          if there are obsessive thoughts or fears, emotions coming up, then be 
          willing to allow them to become conscious so that you can let them go 
          to cessation. If there's nothing coming or going, then just be in the 
          emptiness, in the silence of the mind. You can hear a high frequency 
          sound in the mind, that's always there, it's not an ear sound. You can 
          turn to that, when you let go of the conditions of the mind. But be 
          honest with your intentions. So if you're turning to the silence, the 
          silent sound of the mind, out of aversion to the conditions, it's just 
          a repression again, it's not purification. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If your intention is wrong, even though you do concentrate 
          on emptiness, you will not get a good result, because you've been misled. 
          You haven't wisely reflected on things, you haven't let anything go, 
          you're just turning away out of aversion, just saying, 'I don't want 
          to see that', so you turn away. Now this practice is a patient one of 
          being willing to endure what seems unendurable. It's an inner vigilance, 
          watching, listening, even experimenting. In this practice, the right 
          understanding is the important thing, rather than the emptiness or form 
          or anything like that. Right understanding comes through the reflection 
          that whatever arises, passes away; reflection that even emptiness is 
          not-self. If you claim that you are one who's realised emptiness as 
          if you'd attained something, that in itself is wrong intention, isn't 
          it? Thinking you 're somebody who has attained or realised on the personal 
          level comes from a sense of self. So we make no claims. If there is 
          something inside you that wants to claim something, then you observe 
          <em>that</em> as a condition of the mind. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The sound of silence is always there so you can use 
          it as a guide rather than an end in itself. So it's a very skilful practice 
          of watching and listening, rather than just repressing conditions out 
          of aversion to them. But then the emptiness is pretty boring actually. 
          We're used to having more entertainment. How long can you sit all day 
          being aware of an empty mind, anyway? So recognise that our practice 
          is not to attach to peacefulness or silence or emptiness as an end, 
          but to use it as a skilful means to be the knowing and to be alert. 
          When the mind's empty you can watch -- there's still awareness, but 
          you're not seeking rebirth in any condition, because there's not a sense 
          of self in it. Self always comes with the seeking of something or trying 
          to get rid of something. Listen to the self saying, 'I want to attain 
          samadhi', 'I've got to attain <em>jhana</em>. That's self talking: 'I've 
          got to get first <em>jhana</em>, second <em>jhana</em>, before I can 
          do anything', that idea, you've got to get something first. What can 
          you know when you read the teachings from different teachers? You can 
          know when you're confused, when you're doubting, when you're feeling 
          aversion and suspicion. You can know that you're being the knowing, 
          rather than deciding which teacher is the right one. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The <em>metta</em> practice means to use a gentle kindness 
          by being able to endure what you might believe is unendurable. If you 
          have an obsessed mind that goes on and chats away and nags, and then 
          you want to get rid of it, the more you try to suppress and get rid 
          of it, the worse it gets. And then sometimes it stops and you think, 
          'Oh, I've got rid of it, it's gone.' Then it'll start again and you 
          think, 'Oh no! I thought I'd got rid of that.' So no matter how many 
          times it comes back and goes, or whatever, take it as it comes. Be one 
          who takes one step at a time. When you're willing to be one who has 
          all the patience in the world to be with the existing condition, you 
          can let it cease. The results of allowing things to cease are that you 
          begin to experience release, because you realise that you're not carrying 
          things around that you used to. Somehow things that used to make you 
          angry no longer really bother you very much, and that surprises you. 
          You begin to feel at ease in situations that you never felt at ease 
          in before, because you're allowing things to cease, rather than just 
          holding on and recreating fears and anxieties. Even 'dis-ease' of those 
          around you doesn't influence you. You're not reacting to other's lack 
          of ease by getting tense yourself. That comes through letting go and 
          allowing things to cease. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So the general picture now is for you to have this inner 
          vigilance, and to note any obsessive things that come up. If they keep 
          coming back all the time, then you're obviously attached in some way 
          -- either through aversion or infatuation. So, you can begin to recognise 
          attachment rather than just try to get rid of it. Once you can understand 
          it and you can let go, then you can turn to the silence of the mind 
          because there's no point in doing anything else. There's no point in 
          holding on or hanging on to conditions any longer than necessary. Let 
          them cease. When we react to what arises, we create a cycle of habits. 
          A habit is something that is cyclical, it keeps going in a cycle, it 
          has no way of ceasing. But if you let go, and leave things alone, then 
          what arises ceases. It doesn't become a cycle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So emptiness isn't getting rid of everything; it's not 
          total blankness, but an infinite potential for creation to arise and 
          to pass, without your being deluded by it. The idea of me as a creator, 
          my artistic talents, expressing myself -- it's an incredible egotistical 
          trip, isn't it? 'This is what I've done, this is mine.' They say, 'Oh, 
          you're very skilled, aren't you? You're a genius!' Yet so much of creative 
          art tends to be regurgitations of people's fears and desires. It's not 
          really creative; it's just recreating things. It's not coming from an 
          empty mind, but from an ego, which has no real message to give other 
          than that it's full of death and selfishness. On a universal level it 
          has no real message other than 'Look at me!' as a person, as an ego. 
          Yet the empty mind has infinite potential for creation. One doesn't 
          think of creating things; but creation can be done with no self and 
          nobody doing it -- it happens. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So we leave creation to the Dhamma rather than think 
          that that's something to be responsible for. All we have to do now, 
          all that's necessary for us -- conventionally speaking, as human beings, 
          as people -- is to let go; or not attach. Let things go. Do good, refrain 
          from doing evil, be mindful. Quite a basic message.</font></p>
